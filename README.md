**Arduino Voice Controlled Robotic Vehicle 🤖🗣️🚗**

This repository contains a project for an Arduino-based voice-controlled robotic vehicle. The vehicle can be controlled using a variety of voice commands, such as "move forward", "turn left", "turn right", and "stop".

To build the vehicle, you will need the following components:

* Arduino Uno 🔌
* HC-05 Bluetooth module
* Motor driver 
* Two motors
* Wheels 🛞
* Battery 🔋
* Microphone 🎙️
* Speaker 🔊

Once you have gathered the components, you can follow the instructions in the accompanying tutorial to assemble the vehicle and program the Arduino.

Once the vehicle is assembled and programmed, you can control it using voice commands. To do this, simply connect your smartphone to the Bluetooth module and speak the desired command. The vehicle will then perform the commanded action.

**Example Commands**

* "Go forward" - The vehicle will move forward. ⬆️
* "Turn left" - The vehicle will turn left. ⬅️
* "Turn right" - The vehicle will turn right. ➡️
* "Stop" - The vehicle will stop. ✋

You can also create more complex commands by combining the basic commands. For example, you could say "Go forward and turn left" to make the vehicle move forward and then turn left. ⬆️⬅️

**Usage Tips**

* The voice recognition system is not perfect, so you may need to repeat your commands if the vehicle does not understand you. 📢
* The vehicle is best used on a flat surface. It may not be able to navigate over obstacles. ⚠️
* Be careful not to bump the vehicle into anything. 💥
